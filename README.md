# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/?fbclid=IwAR2K5_BGPVo0QjJXkOIIqNsqcXK4lTskPWJvA0asKQIGtCPWaQBdKmj1Ztg), **without the help of Google:**

## General
* At least four different sorting algorithms
* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
* What is a stable sorting algorithm

# Requirements
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
* All your files should end with a new line
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* Unless specified otherwise, you are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, … is totally forbidden.
* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `sort.h`
* Don’t forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded
* A list/array does not need to be sorted if its size is less than 2.

# More Info
## Data Structure and Functions
* For this project you are given the following `print_array`, and `print_list` functions:

```
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

/**
 * print_array - Prints an array of integers
 *
 * @array: The array to be printed
 * @size: Number of elements in @array
 */
void print_array(const int *array, size_t size)
{
    size_t i;

    i = 0;
    while (array && i < size)
    {
        if (i > 0)
            printf(", ");
        printf("%d", array[i]);
        ++i;
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include "sort.h"

/**
 * print_list - Prints a list of integers
 *
 * @list: The list to be printed
 */
void print_list(const listint_t *list)
{
    int i;

    i = 0;
    while (list)
    {
        if (i > 0)
            printf(", ");
        printf("%d", list->n);
        ++i;
        list = list->next;
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```

* Please declare the prototype of the functions `print_array` and `print_list` in your `sort.h` header file
* Please use the following data structure for doubly linked list:

```
/**
 * struct listint_s - Doubly linked list node
 *
 * @n: Integer stored in the node
 * @prev: Pointer to the previous element of the list
 * @next: Pointer to the next element of the list
 */
typedef struct listint_s
{
    const int n;
    struct listint_s *prev;
    struct listint_s *next;
} listint_t;
```

Please, note this format is used for Quiz and Task questions.
* O(1)
* O(n)
* O(n!)
* n square -> O(n^2)
* log(n) -> O(log(n))
* n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
* n + k -> O(n+k)
* …

Please use the “short” notation (don’t use constants). Example: `O(nk)` or `O(wn)` should be written `O(n)`. If an answer is required within a file, all your answers files must have a newline at the end.
